This bug occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a remote URI that is intermittently unavailable.  The component fails to gracefully handle the loading error, resulting in a blank space or a broken image icon instead of displaying a placeholder or fallback image. This inconsistency makes the UI unpredictable and negatively impacts the user experience.  The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.
